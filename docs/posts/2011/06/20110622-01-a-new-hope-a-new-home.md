Welcome to the new home for Dropbox-PHP related news and announcements.  Look here for announcements about new releases and general news about development on the Dropbox-PHP library.  The [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/dropbox-php) will still be used for general discussions, but this will serve as a point of general notices for those that donâ€™t take part on the mailing list.

Recently, Evert announced on his [blog](http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/blog/throwing-in-the-towel-with-sabreamf-and-dropbox-php-lib) and the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/dropbox-php/browse_thread/thread/57b6808c093dd3a6) that he no longer had the time to continue to keep up the Dropbox-PHP library.  As such it has sat dormant for a few months.  I recently stumbled across it and decided to join in and help support it.  Look for a release announcement tomorrow morning for the first PEAR release since August which includes several community contributed fixes.  I plan to get to the rest of the open issues and begin working to add new functionality to Dropbox-PHP over the next few months.
