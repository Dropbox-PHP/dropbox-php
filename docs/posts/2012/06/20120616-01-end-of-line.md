### Development has stopped ###
Well, if it hasn't been obvious before, it should be now.  Just like Evan before me, I no longer have free time to work on this library.  Also, it seems Dropbox dropped the link to this library from their list of [3rd party APIs](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/sdk).  I tried to get them to add it back, butâ€¦

If anyone is interested in working on this library, I'll find time to manage pull requests.  And if you submit often enough, I'll consider adding you as a committer to the Github project so you can commit directly.

Alternatively, if someone is interested in taking over altogether, I'm willing to consult with Evan and hand over control.

Lastly, if you aren't willing/able to contribute to this library, but still need one that is staying current, it appears there is one that is very similar to this library.  You can find it [here](https://github.com/BenTheDesigner/Dropbox)
