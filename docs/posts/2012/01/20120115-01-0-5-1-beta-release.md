### Additional Changes ###
New with this release is the status change to "Beta".  With the addition 
of tests added in the last release and with a build script added in this 
release, we are getting closer to a stable release.  Additionally, code 
hosting has been moved to GitHub only.  Issue tracking will happen on 
GitHub only now as well.  The Google groups mailing list will remain 
for the foreseeable future.
